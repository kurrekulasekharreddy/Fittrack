FitTrack Pro - Project scaffold generated by ChatGPT.

Structure:
- backend/    Node + Express + Mongoose API
- frontend/   Mobile-first SPA (single index.html) using ES modules

Instructions:
1. Backend:
   - cd backend
   - npm install
   - Set MONGO_URI env if needed, then:
   - npm run dev
2. Frontend:
   - Serve frontend folder with any static file server (VSCode Live Server, python -m http.server, etc.)
   - Open index.html in browser (do NOT use file:// for grading — host it)

Notes:
- Passwords in this demo are plaintext for simplicity. Replace with bcrypt & token auth for production.
- Tests are illustrative and require the server to be running.
